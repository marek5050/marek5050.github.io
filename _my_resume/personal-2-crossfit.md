**Motivation**    
Crossfit has been a trending athletic activity for the past couple of years and has very strong community support. Yet, Googling "Crossfit" the only search results that show up are disjoint local Crossfit gyms. So.. Crossfit.Social will act as a hub for all thing Crossfit. It will be a convergence of the various social media websites like Flikr, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. For example the main page will have display the most talked about images, posts, and events. But if users are more interested in a specific region say "Central" for Texas, they'll be able to select it and we'll filter down and just display the local events and feeds.
