The internship was a great experience where I got to build a front end UI using EXT JS, picking up the current concepts and resources provided by the team and applying EXT JS's MVC methodology in order to create a robust interface with Models, Stores, and Proxies, all while maintaining IE 8 compatibility. 

I oversaw and steered the development of an internal website built using Knockout JS, which included Google services, such as Google Maps, Places, and News API.
