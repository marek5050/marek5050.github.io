A static web hosting service leveraging Amazon Web Services. Allows users to deploy websites directly from Github without worrying about the underlying build process.
We integrated various tools such as npm, Grunt, Gulp, and Sass to build the user's website. Then it's deployed into an S3 bucket and CloudFront takes care of the CDN functionality to increase performance and loading speeds.
