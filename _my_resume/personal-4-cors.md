An HTTP proxy to bypass Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions within the browser. 

<details class="hidden-print">
Many times I experienced the need to create Javascript AJAX calls to request data from various online sources. But with no back-end support I was under the limitations of Cross Origin Resource Sharing **CORS**. 
This website accepts AJAX calls and creates a request as specified returning the contents of the remote destination. (Example usage: front page AmodernStory.com Blog posts and Footer's Google Ticker)
