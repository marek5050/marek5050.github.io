Last week's project went great, it also seemed too easy. This weeks project we're gonna create a huge integer, which doesn't necessarily sound extremely challenging either. It might be because I'm finally feeling comfortable with C++. Even thought sadly, I've only been learning Python for about 2 months compared to almost a year of C++, I very much feel more proficient in Python. I think it's because as a web developer I'm having a hard time finding practical uses with C++. 

I've talked to a couple of student that work on video games and they use C++ for OpenGL and the other graphical libraries. I can see how that would work, maybe I can try picking it up too eventually :) For right now I'll just have to grind out the C stuff. The Professor Downing has been amazing as always, it's just me building the mental connections that's been lacking. 

Maybe this week during my free time I'll try using one of the web server technologies for C++ like [Wt][wt]. Maybe even checkout and mess with the [NodeJS source code][node] or [Ogre3D engine][ogre] some graphics. These items sound like fun so we'll see and I'll update you all this coming week! 


## Tip of the week
Group study sessions are great! Especially when you find a great group of people to study with! 
  
This week I definitely recommend
