CS373 Software Engineering is a class I've been looking forward to ever since I first entered Computer Science at UT Austin. ![Utexas](https://www.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/images/Trademarked_Silhouette2.jpg ){:.some-css-class style="width: 50px"} The [syllabus](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/) and description sounds very promising. I've learned so much already (Jekyll, Travis CI, and Python) and we are just entering week 2! 

	This is a course on software engineering using Python, Javascript, and Java. It will include the creation of a website with a database backend using the following tools: Apiary, RESTful APIs, AngularJS or React, SQLAlchemy, Flask or Django, MySQL or PostgreSQL, and Rackspace. It is also strongly focused on using tools to improve the quality of software development, including source control with git and GitHub, unit testing with Mocha and UnitTest, coverage with Istanbul and Coverage, continuos integration with Travis CI, and documentation with JSDoc and PyDoc.

We've already started going through Python and Javascript. While I'm very familiar with Javascript, Python has always elluded me, so finally I'm taking a class where I'll get to learn it. We've started off using __unittest__, __coverage3__, and __PyDoc__ with the first Collatz project. 


##Tip of the Week:
I'm loving Python Notebook for troubleshooting and general programming. It's so easy to debug code and run tests, compared to PyCharm or anything from the terminal.
