Warning #2: This guide does not follow the typical development pattern. Code then think.   

# Building in Go!
I very much enjoy working in Go because of it's simplicity. There's a very small number
of rules and exceptions one needs to familiarize with. The packages come with tests and great
examples. With a great IDE it's a very easy language to use.

I'm trying to understand channels and concurrency so we'll design a program
that will do heap sort using go methods and channels. 
  

## Start of with a design


## Create a few tests
 
## Start coding
