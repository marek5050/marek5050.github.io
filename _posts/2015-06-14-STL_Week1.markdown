First week of Generic Programming has been pretty much a repeat of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) that I took last semester. Hopefully taking an identical course will only reinforce my C++ capabilities! Go Longhorns!

We can find both the [schedule][schedule] and the [syllabus][syllabus] on [Downing's UT website][downing]. From the schedule and rumors it seems the first two projects and most of the readings will be identical. This might overall be a good thing since I have both of them already completed. Atleast I'll be able to focus a little more on Physics and the part-time jobs I have.

## Tip of the week
[Jekyll Cheatsheet][jekyll] has been an extremely useful reference while putting together the Jekyll github page. It has a very good variety of information and also a couple of guides on the bottom. 
[Markdown Reference][markdown] I'd also recommend this __Markdown__ reference which has been my go to source of information ever since I started blogging using Markdown.
