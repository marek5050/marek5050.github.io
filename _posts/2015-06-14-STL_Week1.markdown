First week of Generic Programming has been pretty much a repeat of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) that I took last semester. Hopefully taking an identical course will only reinforce my C++ capabilities! Go Longhorns!

We can find both the [schedule][schedule] and the [syllabus][syllabus] on [Downing's UT website][downing]. From the schedule and rumors it seems the first two projects and most of the readings will be identical. Atleast I'll be able to focus a little more on Physics and the part-time jobs I have.

Overall I love the fact we started using Github Pages and Jekyll for blogging. It's another one of those things I would have never touched on my own, just like Travis CI. Another reason why these classes are so valuable. 

## Tip of the week
__[Configuring GTest on Mac][gtest]__ a guide I put together this week about the configuration of GTest. 

[Jekyll Cheatsheet][jekyll] has been an extremely useful reference while putting together the Jekyll github page. It has a very good variety of information and also a couple of guides on the bottom. 

I'd also recommend this __[Markdown reference][markdown]__ which has been my go to source of information ever since I started blogging using Markdown.
